        <p>Oh my love
Did they tell you
Just how long a time
It took for me to get to you<br>

<br>And when the world
Said it's impossible
Said it's improbable
The chances of me finding you<br>

<br>Nobody knows
How we go
Oh when we're alone
It's like we're home<br>

<br>My bones are safe
And my heart can rest
Knowing it belongs to you you
My world is changed<br>

<br>And it's cradled by
The comfort that is
You you you you
You you you you<br>

<br>Oh my love
My head is reeling
And I am running out of air
I need to breathe in<br>

<br>I didn't know
That it was possible
To put all that I am
At the palm of your hands<br>

<br>Now we're unstoppable
Nobody knows
How we go
Oh when we're alone
It's like we're home<br>

<br>My bones are safe
And my heart can rest
Knowing it belongs to you you
My world is changed<br>

<br>And it's cradled by
The comfort that is
You you you you
You you you you<br>

<br>Nobody knows
How we go
Oh when we're alone
It's like we're home<br>

<br>Nobody knows
How we go
Oh when we're alone
It's like we're home<br>

<br>Nobody knows
How we go
Oh when we're alone
It's like we're home<br>

<br>Nobody knows
How we go
Oh when we're alone
It's like we're home<br>

<br>My bones are safe
And my heart can rest
Knowing it belongs to you you
My world is changed
And it's cradled by
The comfort that is<br>

<br>You you you
You you you
You you you
You you you (my bones are safe and my heart can rest knowing it belongs to you)<br>

<br>You you you
You you you (my world is changed And it's cradled by The comfort that is you)
You you you
You you you (my bones are safe and my heart can rest knowing it belongs to you)
You you (oh oh)</p>
