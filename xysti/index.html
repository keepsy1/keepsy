        <p>Dress by Taylor Swift<br><br>

         Our secret moments in your crowded room
         They got no idea about me and you
         There is an indentation in the shape of you
         Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo<br>

         <br>All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
         My hands are shaking from holding back from you 
         All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
         My hands are shaking from all this<br>

         <br>Say my name and everything just stops
         I don't want you like a best friend
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Take it off<br>

         <br>Carve your name into my bedpost
         'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Take it off<br>

         <br>Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
         And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
         I'm spilling wine in the bathtub<br>

         <br>You kiss my face and we're both drunk
         Everyone thinks that they know us
         But they know nothing about<br>

         <br>All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
         My hands are shaking from holding back from you
         All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
         My hands are shaking from all this<br>

         <br>Say my name and everything just stops
         I don't want you like a best friend
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Take it off<br>

         <br>Carve your name into my bedpost
         'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Take it off<br>

         <br>Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Flashback when you met me
         Your buzzcut and my hair bleached<br>

         <br>Even in my worst times
         You could see the best of me
         Flashback to my mistakes
         My rebounds, my earthquakes
         Even in my worst lies
         You saw the truth in me<br>

         <br>And I woke up just in time
         Now I wake up by your side
         My one and only, my lifeline
         I woke up just in time
         Now I wake up by your side
         My hands shake, I can't explain this ah, ha, ha, ha<br>

         <br>Say my name and everything just stops
         I don't want you like a best friend
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Take it off<br>

         <br>Carve your name into my bedpost
         'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off
         Take it off<br>

         <br>There is an indentation in the shape of you
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off<br>

         <br>You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
         Only bought this dress so you could take it off</p>
