        Hello Nix,<br>

<br>As your mentor, I want to express my sincerest gratitude for the time, effort, and heart you’ve poured into your teaching practice over the past few weeks. It has been a true pleasure to witness your journey—watching you evolve from a student into a capable, compassionate, and inspiring future educator.<br>

<br>You came in with a willingness to learn, a positive attitude, and a genuine love for teaching and those qualities have shone through in everything you’ve done. Your creativity in lesson planning, your rapport with students, and your reflective approach to feedback have all been impressive. You’ve shown resilience in facing challenges, and most importantly, a deep care for your learners’ growth.<br>

<br>I’ve seen you grow in confidence and skill, and I’m proud of all the progress you’ve made.
As you take the next steps in your teaching career, know that I’ll always be cheering you on. Continue to embrace every opportunity with the same enthusiasm and integrity you’ve shown here. Keep growing, keep reflecting, and never lose sight of the reason you chose this path.<br>

<br>Thank you again for allowing me to be part of your journey. It’s been an honor to guide and learn alongside you.<br>

<br>With love,<br>
Miss Xysti</p>
