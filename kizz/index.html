         You know I've found<br>
          The love that's in your eyes<br>
          You know I'll be
          The one that wanted you by my side
          I’ve found a getaway that we could hide away
          It's a raft that I've found
          I cracked a cold one and ask for you to stay
          I'm just sayin'<br>


          <br>Won't you stay here with me<br>
          Watching the whole world slide away?<br>
          Won't you stay here with me<br>
          Watching the stars shines bright at night<br>
          All that I ask is for you to stay<br>
          I’ve never wanted to be alone<br>
          All that I ask is never to leave<br>
          Even if the sky let down on us<br>

          <br>~H 3 F - Just Sayin'<br>

          With you, even a raft in the middle of the sea feels like the safest place in the world. Just a cold drink and your laughter. I never wanted to be alone, but with you, I’ll never have to be. What we have is simple, isn’t it? It doesn’t need to try… because with you, every shadow of loneliness disappears.<br>  

          <br>You’re my safe harbor, my “always.” <br>

          With all my heart,<br>  
          Kizz💗</p>
