        <p>My Love,<br>

<br>Happy 8th of the month, my love. 🤍<br>

<br>Another month apart, and still, my love for you only grows stronger. I know this distance isn't easy, but it reminds me just how deeply I care about you—how you're always on my mind, even when we're miles away.<br>

<br>Even though I can't be there to hug and kiss you today, I hope you can feel how tightly I’m holding you in my heart. The distance between us are nothing compared to the connection we’ve built. We’re not just counting time—we’re building something real, something special.<br> 

<br>I’m proud of us. I’m proud of you. And I believe in what we have more than anything. Until I can say it in person - I love you so much. More than you’ll ever know, love. <br>

<br>Here’s to more months and years together—and to all the ones still to come and celebrate with you, love.</p>
