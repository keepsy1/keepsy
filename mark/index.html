        <p>Two years of laughter, late night conversations, random escapades, as well as the small and quiet moments that matter the most. You have brought a lot of positivity in my life and I remain eternally thankful for every moment we have experienced together.<br><br>The simplest and the most beautiful thing I have done is love you. You have taught me true love is patient, calm, powerful, and genuine. I appreciate you for being my partner, best friend, and my comfort zone.<br><br> I look forward to the countless late-night drives, working towards shared goals, and relishing the countless adventures life has to offer us.<br><br> Together is what matters the most and I am super excited to grow with you, continue building our future together, and most importantly, love you more with each passing day</p>
